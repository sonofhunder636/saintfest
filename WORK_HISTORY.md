# Work History - Saintfest Homepage Formatting

## Session Date: August 21, 2025

### Completed Work: "Latest Within Saintfest" Section Formatting

**Issue:** The "Latest Within Saintfest" section (blog posts section) had broken formatting after previous responsive optimization work. Text was stuck to the left side of the webpage instead of being centered.

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Fixed centering issues** by using inline styles with `textAlign: 'center'` instead of relying on Tailwind classes
2. **Restructured post layout** with proper title/date grouping
3. **Applied consistent spacing** between posts

**Specific Changes Made:**

#### Section Header:
- Title: Set to `fontSize: '4rem'` with `textAlign: 'center'`
- Container: `max-w-2xl mx-auto` for proper width constraints

#### Individual Blog Posts:
- **Title & Date Structure:** Wrapped in div with centered alignment
- **Title spacing:** `marginBottom: '0.25rem'` for minimal space between title and date
- **Date display:** `display: 'block'` to put date on next line below title
- **Content:** All paragraphs have `textAlign: 'center'`
- **Continue Reading links:** `marginBottom: '4rem'` for proper separation between posts

#### Footer Quote (Hebrews):
- Quote text: `fontSize: '3rem'` with `textAlign: 'center'`
- Scripture reference: `fontSize: '2rem'` with `textAlign: 'center'`

### Key Learning:
Tailwind CSS classes were not working reliably for centering this content. Had to use inline styles with `textAlign: 'center'` to achieve proper centering. This suggests there may be conflicting CSS or specificity issues in the existing stylesheet.

### Deployment:
- Successfully built with `npm run build`
- Deployed to Firebase hosting at https://saintfestcode.web.app
- Responsive formatting verified to work on desktop

### Outstanding Issues:
1. **Navigation banner needs mobile optimization** - reported as not looking right on phone
2. **Root cause of centering issues** - should investigate why Tailwind classes weren't working

### Files Modified:
- `app/page.tsx` - Main homepage component with "Latest Within Saintfest" section

### Next Session Priorities:
1. Fix navigation banner for mobile devices
2. Investigate and resolve underlying CSS centering issues
3. Consider moving inline styles to proper CSS classes once root cause is identified
